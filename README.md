This Java code represents a basic banking system simulation. Here's a breakdown of what each class and method does:

1. **options Class**: It displays the various options available to the user in the banking system, such as money transfer, bill payment, account statement viewing, raising complaints, viewing profile details, and exiting the system.

2. **transfer Class**: It handles the functionality related to money transfer. It prompts the user to enter details like account numbers, beneficiary bank name, amount, etc., and simulates a successful money transfer.

3. **bills Class**: This class deals with bill payment operations. It asks for details like mobile operator, mobile number, amount, card details, and processes the bill payment.

4. **statement Class**: It provides the functionality to view bank account statements. It displays a sample account statement with transaction details.

5. **complaint Class**: This class allows users to raise complaints by entering their account number, complaint details, and contact information. It simulates a confirmation message and suggests waiting for a representative to contact them.

6. **profile_details Class**: It shows the user's profile details like account holder name, account type, and branch address.

7. **core Class**: This class contains the main logic of the program. It handles user input and invokes the appropriate methods based on the user's choice. The `helloo()` method inside `core` class is the core logic that routes the user to different functionalities based on their input.

The `core_java_project` class serves as the entry point to the program, displaying a welcome message and initiating the options for the user to choose from.

This code can be used as a simple demonstration of how a banking system's basic functionalities work. It doesn't involve actual banking operations but provides a framework for understanding how such systems can be structured and interact with users.
